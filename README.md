# Microsoft UK Partner Event - Days of the Defenders
Welcome to the Github repository for the UK Security Partner event - Days of the Defenders.

## Date and times
***Moving to the start of 2023 due to train strikes and logical problems.***

## Event Overview
Over two days, Microsoft security architects will offer a fast-paced, demo-intensive experience designed to ground attendees in the latest Microsoft security tools. It will also equip you with the knowledge and tools to successfully have security discussions with your customers.

The last day offers a fun, competitive Capture the Flag game where you can prove your skills and demonstrate you know your way around the Defender products. You will leave understanding how to position, design, and plan for common scenarios with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft 365 Defender workloads.

Discover answers to common questions including:
 - How can my customers best use Defender for Cloud to secure their Azure, hybrid, and third-party cloud workloads?
 - What are the best scenarios for positioning Microsoft Sentinel, and how can it improve security operations center efficiency?
 - What capabilities exist in the Microsoft Defender suite for protecting Microsoft 365 workloads?

*Who should attend the event?*
Those with a basic understanding of Microsoft 365 and Azure products and who function as pre-sales architects, deployment consultants, or technical sales.
